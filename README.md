# Unnamed Text-Editor
Using ncurses this is my attempt to create my own text-editor. It is supposed to be heavily focused on keybinds and efficiency, the goal is to include many functions from vscode while still feeling like VIM or Emacs. How far this text-editor will evolve is very uncertain, however I'd like to atleast create my own hello world with it.


## Clone repo
```console
git clone https://github.com/Skarkii/text-editor
```

## Goals
 - [ ] Add multiple Windows
 - [ ] Be able to write all keys from the Swedish layout. 
 - [ ] Be able to read and write to files
 - [ ] Run console commands
 - [ ] Add combined key commands
 - [ ] Find/search/replace
 - [ ] Treat file as project looking for .git folder, this includes searching for functions within the project and quick changing between files.
 - [ ] Much more
